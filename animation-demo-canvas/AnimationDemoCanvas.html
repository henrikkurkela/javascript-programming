    This example demonstrates how animation can be created.
    'Animation' in this program means that there is a blinking
    ball on the screen.

    There are notes at the end of this file.

    A NOTE RELATED TO HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY:

    This program can be used to demonstrate the strange 
    behaviour of our sight system. If you watch the blinking ball
    from a short distance, you'll notice that when the ball disappears
    from the screen you see a kind of shadow of the ball. The color
    of the shadowish ball seems to be close to magenta, which is a
    kind of opposite color to cyan, the color of the 'real' ball.
    The reason for seeing this kind of shadow of the ball is in
    our eyes. Our sight system is such that the sight cells inside
    our eyes remember the object (i.e. the ball) that disappears,
    but they produce the opposite color for the disappeared object.
    (This nice feature in this program was discovered by professor
    Matti WeckstrÃ¶m from the University of Oulu.)
